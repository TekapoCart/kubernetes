# This is the only manifest in the project. It sets up a single pod with 1
# replica. That pod contains two containers, phpMyAdmin and Cloud SQL Proxy. Both
# containers rely on the GKE secrets that were added as part of the creation
# scripts. There is no Service because we are using a very simple port-forward
# to access the pod.
